My project generates meal options or combinations based on specified calories from the user. These options/meals are dependent on the type of diet as well as the type of meal.

When the user opens the page, a choice of diets (keto, vegetarian. Vegan, and omnivore) will be presented. After this, the type of meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner) will be shown and the chance to input a desired caloric intake.

* ALLERGEN OPTION MAY BE INCLUDED*

Based on this, a meal will be presented that satisfies the above factors.

My project aims to help with :

-Easy meal planning
-Easy dieting
-Eliminates the need to manually calculate calories for each ingredient before cooking.
- Less consuming way of calorie counting as compared to processes in apps like MyFitnessPal,etc.
- Indecisiveness when it comes to what to eat
